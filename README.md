# 6-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon
Select 2 actors and I'll find the closest link between them using movies they've acted in.

This script uses a Breadth-First shortest-distance algorithim to search the filmography of any 2 actors to find the shortest 'connection' between them: a series of 1 or more movies that the actors/actresses have appeared in that eventually connect the 2. 

Example:

Steve Carrell & Jude Law:

Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty

Jim Carrey and Jude Law in A Series of Unfortunate Events

Steve Carrell & Jude Law are 2 degrees apart.
